During the winter term we will try to more events rather than regular meetings.


Here is a list of ideas:

* Quadcopter (Flying Benny the Beaver)
* Beaglebone/Pi app connections
* Transportation app with public policy department
* Hardware stuff (GPS, GPU, Accelerator, Gyro, Camera, Bluetooth, Barometer)
* Puzzle Night (Really good for interviews)
